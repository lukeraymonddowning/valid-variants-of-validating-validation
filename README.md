# Valid Variants of Validating Validation

A talk originally prepared for [Laracon Online](https://laracon.net) on September 14, 2022.

The talk covers three valid ways of testing validation and controller logic in Laravel applications:
1. Snapshots
2. Shared arrays
3. Request factories

It discusses the pros and cons of each approach, as well as considering the best way to utilise
each approach to be as efficient, readable and maintainable as possible.
